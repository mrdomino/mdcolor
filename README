This is a visual representation for 256-bit numbers (specifically, SHA-256
hashes). The intent is to make it easy to compare two hashes for equality, and
hard to construct two hashes that look similar. This is accomplished by
interpreting the hash as a 4x4 grid of 16-bit colors (5 bits red, 5 bits blue,
6 bits green).
